# Mortgage Calculator
Buying a house is scary. Even if people say buying a house is a good idea, spending half a million dollars on one is a big commitment.

Currently, my wife and I are renting a great condo at a fair rate, but kind of want to buy a house that we can settle in and have some sort of equity. With housing being so expensive where we live, I can't help but wonder if it is better to rent than to buy. 

If it's better to buy, what should my price range be? Sure, I may be able to pay that mortgage every month, but how much money am I dumping towards interest, taxes, and insurance? Yeah, yeah, buying becomes advantageous once you hold on to the house for a few years. Well, exactly how many years does that take? What value are you assuming for home appreciation? How does it change with closing costs? Is the decision to rent or buy as simple as comparing your interest, taxes, and insurance to what you would be paying for rent?

These are the questions I've been agonizing over and this jupyter notebook has helped me answer them.
